I decided to work with a powerlifting dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/open-powerlifting/powerlifting-database). The dataset is a record of the squat, bench, and
deadlift numbers at powerlifting meets. I filtered the data to minimize the effect of confounding variables. I limited the age range from 18-39, only recorded raw(powerlifter 
term meaning unequiped lifts), and I separated the data by gender.

Using the data that I had, I created [visualizations]() to display the relation between bodyweight and weight lifted for each of the three powerlifting lifts.
